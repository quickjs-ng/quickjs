# Welcome to QuickJS-NG

QuickJS is a small and embeddable JavaScript engine. It aims to support the latest
[ECMAScript] specification.

This project is a _fork_ of the [original QuickJS project] by Fabrice Bellard and Charlie Gordon, after it went dormant, with the intent of reigniting its development.

This project is focused on (but not limited to):

- Community development
- Testing
- Cross-platform support
- ES features

You can check the differences with the original project [here.](./diff)

:::note
This site is under construction, the entire API is not yet documented.

## Getting Started

Head over to [building](./building) if you want to build QuickJS from source or [installation](./installation)
for installing it from prebuilt binaries.
