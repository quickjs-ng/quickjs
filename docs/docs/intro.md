# Welcome to QuickJS-NG

QuickJS is a small and embeddable JavaScript engine. It aims to support the latest
[ECMAScript] specification.

This project is a _fork_ of the [original QuickJS project] by Fabrice Bellard, after it went
dormant for several years, with the intent of reigniting its development.

In October 2023 [@bnoordhuis] and [@saghul] decided to fork the original project with
the aim of reigniting it. They reached out to the original authors ([@bellard] and [@chqrlie])
about their intentions.

As of December 2023 the initial goal was somewhat accomplished. [@bellard] resumed working on
the project and both parties have been pulling patches from each other since.

As of early 2024 both projects agree the proper path forward involves merging both projects
and combining the efforts. While that may take a while, since both projects diverged in certain
areas, there is willingness to go in this direction from both sides.

This fork is focused on (but not limited to):

- Community development
- Testing
- Cross-platform support
- ES features
