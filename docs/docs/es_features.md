# ECMAScript Features

QuickJS aims to support the latest available ECMAScript features once they hit the spec.

Progress on _test262_ compliance can be checked [here](https://test262.fyi/#|qjs_ng).

Due to size constraints it is unlikely QuickJS will ever support the [Intl](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) APIs.
