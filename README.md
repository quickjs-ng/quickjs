# ⚡️ QuickJS - A mighty JavaScript engine

## Overview

QuickJS is a small and embeddable JavaScript engine. It aims to support the latest
[ECMAScript] specification.

This project is a _fork_ of the [original QuickJS project] by Fabrice Bellard and Charlie Gordon, after it went dormant, with the intent of reigniting its development.
