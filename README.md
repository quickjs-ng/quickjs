# ⚡️ QuickJS - A mighty JavaScript engine

Friendly [QuickJS]() fork focused on reigniting the project.

## Overview

In October 2023 [@bnoordhuis] and [@saghul] decided to fork the [QuickJS] project with
the aim of reigniting it. They reached out to the original authors ([@bellard] and [@chqrlie])
about their intentions.

As of December 2023 the initial goal was somewhat accomplished. [@bellard] resumed working on
the project and both parties have been pulling patches from each other since.

As of early 2024 both projects agree the proper path forward involves merging both projects
and combining the efforts. While that may take a while, since both projects diverged in certain
areas, there is willingness to go in this direction from both sides.
